    "\n",
    "### What is a Support Vector Machine (SVM)?\n",
    "SVM is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used for **classification** and **regression** tasks. But it's most famous for **classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of SVM as a **smart separator**. It tries to find the best line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that **clearly separates** different classes in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Idea:\n",
    "Imagine you have two groups of points on a graph. You want to draw a line that separates them as clearly as possible. SVM finds the **widest possible margin** between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The points that are **closest to the line** are called **support vectors**.\n",
    "- These are the **most important points** in defining the decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How SVM Works (Simplified):\n",
    "1. **Input Data**: You have labeled data (e.g., red dots and blue dots).\n",
    "2. **Find the Best Line**: SVM tries to find a line that **maximizes the margin** between the two classes.\n",
    "3. **Support Vectors**: The data points closest to the line are the **support vectors**.\n",
    "4. **Decision Boundary**: The line that separates the classes is the **decision boundary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example in 2D:\n",
    "Let’s say you have two classes: cats and dogs. Each has features like weight and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM will try to find the **best line** that separates cats from dogs. The line that gives the **maximum distance** from the nearest cat and dog is the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernels in SVM:\n",
    "Sometimes, the data isn't linearly separable (you can't draw a straight line to separate the classes). That’s where **kernels** come in!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Kernel Trick**: It transforms the data into a higher dimension where it becomes linearly separable.\n",

    "## 🧮 2. **Why Use Kernels?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **primal form**, the decision boundary is a **hyperplane** in the original input space.\n",

    "But in many real-world problems, the data is **not linearly separable** — you **can’t draw a straight line** to separate the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where **kernels** come in.\n",

    "Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of computing the **mapping function Φ(x)** (which could be very expensive), we use a **kernel function K(x, y)** that computes the **inner product in the high-dimensional space**:\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🧮 4. **How Kernels Work in the Dual Form**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **dual form** of SVM, the **decision function** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\text{sign} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha_i y_i K(x_i, x) + b \\right)\n",

    "- $ \\alpha_i $ are the **Lagrange multipliers** (non-zero only for support vectors).\n",
    "- $ y_i $ are the **labels**.\n",
    "- $ K(x_i, x) $ is the **kernel function**.\n",
    "- $ b $ is the **bias term**.\n",
