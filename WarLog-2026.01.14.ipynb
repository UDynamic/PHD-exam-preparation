    "\n",
    "In building a **Random Forest**, each tree is constructed using a **Bootstrap sample** from the training data. If `n` is the total number of training samples and `d` is the number of features, on average, how many **unique samples** does each tree use?\n",

    "\n",
    "1) $ \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n $  \n",
    "2) $ 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^d $  \n",

    "### ✅ **Understanding Bootstrap Sampling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **Bootstrap sampling**, each tree in the Random Forest is trained on a **sample with replacement** from the full training set of size `n`.\n",
    "- This means that for each sample in the training set, the **probability of being selected in one Bootstrap sample** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  P(\\text{sample is selected}) = 1 - P(\\text{sample is not selected in n draws})\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probability that a specific sample is **not selected** in one draw is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  1 - \\frac{1}{n}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probability that it is **not selected in all n draws** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- So, the probability that a specific sample **is selected at least once** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Therefore, the **expected number of unique samples** in a Bootstrap sample is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  n \\cdot \\left[1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n\\right]\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "But the question is asking for the **average number of samples used per tree**, which is **approximately 63.2% of n** (as $ 1 - (1 - 1/n)^n \\approx 0.632 $ for large n).\n",
