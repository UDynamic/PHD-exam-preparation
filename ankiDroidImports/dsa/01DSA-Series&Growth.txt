01DS0001	Basic	01DSA-Series&Growth	What is the closed-form expression for summing a constant \(c\) from index \(n_1\) to \(n_2\)?	The sum is the constant multiplied by the number of terms.<br>\( \sum_{i=n_1}^{n_2} c = (n_2 - n_1 + 1) \cdot c \)<br><em>Note: The number of terms is \((n_2 - n_1 + 1)\), not \((n_2 - n_1)\).</em>
01DS0002	Basic	01DSA-Series&Growth	What is the formula for the sum \(S_n\) of a finite geometric series \(a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^{n-1}\) for \(r \neq 1\)?	The sum is given by the first term times the ratio of one minus the common ratio to the power \(n\) to one minus the common ratio.<br>\( S_n = a \cdot \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}, \quad r \neq 1 \)
01DS0003	Basic	01DSA-Series&Growth	Under what condition does an infinite geometric series converge, and what is its sum?	It converges if the absolute value of the common ratio is less than 1. The sum is the first term divided by one minus the common ratio.<br>\( \text{If } |r| < 1, \quad S = a + ar + ar^2 + ... = \frac{a}{1 - r} \)
01DS0004	Basic	01DSA-Series&Growth	What does \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = c\) (where \(0 < c < \infty\)) imply about the asymptotic relationship between \(f(n)\) and \(g(n)\)?	It implies that \(f(n)\) grows at the same rate as \(g(n)\) asymptotically, denoted by Theta notation.<br>\( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2n+1}{n+1} = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2n+1 = \Theta(n) \)
01DS0005	Basic	01DSA-Series&Growth	What is the "absorption rule" when summing terms with different asymptotic growth rates?	In a sum of functions, the term with the fastest growth rate asymptotically dominates and "absorbs" the others. The overall growth is Theta of the fastest growing term.<br>\( 2^n + n^5 - \log(n) = \Theta(2^n) \)
01DS0006	Basic	01DSA-Series&Growth	Why does the base of a logarithm not matter in Big-O, Theta, and Omega notations?	Logarithms of different bases are constant multiples of each other. Asymptotic notations ignore constant factors.<br>\( \log_a(n) = \frac{\log_b(n)}{\log_b(a)} = \Theta(\log_b(n)) \)
01DS0007	Basic	01DSA-Series&Growth	What is the asymptotic growth (Theta) of the sum of the first \(n\) positive integers: \(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\)?	The sum is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\), which is a quadratic polynomial. Therefore, its growth is Theta of \(n^2\).<br>\( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \Theta(n^2) \)
01DS0008	Basic	01DSA-Series&Growth	What is the asymptotic growth of the sum from \(n/2\) to \(n\), i.e., \(\sum_{i=n/2}^{n} i\)?	This sum also has quadratic growth. The number of terms is ~\(n/2\) and the average term is ~\(3n/4\), leading to a Theta of \(n^2\).<br>\( \sum_{i=n/2}^{n} i = \Theta(n^2) \)
01DS0009	Basic	01DSA-Series&Growth	How do you find the asymptotic growth of \(T(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + \frac{1}{i})\)?	Split the sum, analyze the growth of each part, and apply the absorption rule.<br>\( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \Theta(n^2), \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{i} = \Theta(\log n) \)<br>\( \Theta(n^2) + \Theta(\log n) = \Theta(n^2) \)
01DS0010	Basic	01DSA-Series&Growth	What is a common error when applying the constant summation formula \(\sum_{i=n_1}^{n_2} c\)?	Forgetting to add 1 to the difference in limits to get the correct number of terms. The correct formula is \((n_2 - n_1 + 1) \cdot c\), not \((n_2 - n_1) \cdot c\).
01DS0011	Basic	01DSA-Series&Growth	When analyzing algorithms, when would you use the infinite geometric series sum formula versus the finite one?	Use the <em>finite</em> formula when the number of iterations/terms \(n\) is known and explicit (e.g., a loop running \(n\) times). Use the <em>infinite</em> formula primarily in convergence proofs or when analyzing theoretical infinite processes, which are less common in basic algorithm analysis.
01DS0012	Basic	01DSA-Series&Growth	When summing functions, can you always drop all but the fastest-growing term to find the Theta bound?	Yes, for <em>sums</em>, the absorption rule holds: \(\Theta(f(n)) + \Theta(g(n)) = \Theta(\max(f(n), g(n)))\). However, be careful with products (e.g., in nested loops) where terms multiply, requiring different rules.
