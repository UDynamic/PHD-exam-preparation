    "\n",
    "### What is a Support Vector Machine (SVM)?\n",
    "SVM is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used for **classification** and **regression** tasks. But it's most famous for **classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of SVM as a **smart separator**. It tries to find the best line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that **clearly separates** different classes in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Idea:\n",
    "Imagine you have two groups of points on a graph. You want to draw a line that separates them as clearly as possible. SVM finds the **widest possible margin** between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The points that are **closest to the line** are called **support vectors**.\n",
    "- These are the **most important points** in defining the decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How SVM Works (Simplified):\n",
    "1. **Input Data**: You have labeled data (e.g., red dots and blue dots).\n",
    "2. **Find the Best Line**: SVM tries to find a line that **maximizes the margin** between the two classes.\n",
    "3. **Support Vectors**: The data points closest to the line are the **support vectors**.\n",
    "4. **Decision Boundary**: The line that separates the classes is the **decision boundary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example in 2D:\n",
    "Let’s say you have two classes: cats and dogs. Each has features like weight and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM will try to find the **best line** that separates cats from dogs. The line that gives the **maximum distance** from the nearest cat and dog is the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernels in SVM:\n",
    "Sometimes, the data isn't linearly separable (you can't draw a straight line to separate the classes). That’s where **kernels** come in!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Kernel Trick**: It transforms the data into a higher dimension where it becomes linearly separable.\n",
    "- Common kernels:\n",
    "  - **Linear Kernel** (for simple data)\n",

    "### 1. **Linear SVM (Hard Margin)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume we have a **linearly separable dataset**. The goal is to find a **hyperplane** that separates the two classes with the **maximum margin**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Hyperplane Equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w \\cdot x + b = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "- $ w $: weight vector (normal to the hyperplane)\n",
    "- $ x $: input data point\n",
    "- $ b $: bias term\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Margin:\n",
    "The **margin** is the distance between the hyperplane and the **closest data points** (support vectors). The margin is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Margin} = \\frac{2}{\\|w\\|}\n",

    "#### Optimization Goal:\n",
    "We want to **maximize the margin**, which is equivalent to **minimizing $ \\|w\\| $**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the **optimization problem** is:\n",
    "$$\n",
