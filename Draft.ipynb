    "## Constraint vs Penalty Equivalence\n",
    "**Front:** How are the constraint formulation R(θ) ≤ t and penalty formulation L(θ) + λR(θ) related? <br/>\n",
    "**Back:** They are equivalent via Lagrange multipliers. For every constraint size t, there exists a λ such that solving the constrained problem gives the same solution as minimizing L(θ) + λR(θ). The KKT conditions ensure this duality: at the optimal point, ∇L(θ) = -λ∇R(θ).\n",

    "## Regularization Path Construction\n",
    "**Front:** How do you construct a regularization path from the geometric perspective? <br/>\n",
    "**Back:** Draw constraint regions (diamonds/circles) of increasing sizes t₁ < t₂ < t₃ < ... For each region, find where a loss contour touches it. Plot these contact points as t varies—this trace forms the regularization path, showing how optimal coefficients change with constraint tightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Corner Solutions in L1\n",
    "**Front:** Why does L1 regularization often produce solutions at diamond corners? <br/>\n",
    "**Back:** Because diamond corners represent points where one coordinate is exactly zero. When a loss contour touches a diamond at a corner, the solution has sparsity (some coefficients = 0). This occurs because diamond corners \"stick out,\" making them likely contact points for elliptical loss contours.\n",

    "## Practical Path Finding\n",
    "**Front:** Given a specific λ, how do you find the corresponding constraint size t geometrically? <br/>\n",
    "**Back:** 1. Solve min L(θ) + λR(θ) to get θ*. 2. Compute t = R(θ*). This t is exactly the constraint size whose boundary would be touched by a loss contour at θ*. Alternatively, for a given t, the corresponding λ is the Lagrange multiplier at the contact point."
