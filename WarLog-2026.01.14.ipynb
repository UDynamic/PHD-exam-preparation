    "PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique, not a classification algorithm. However, it can be used as a preprocessing step for classification tasks. Here's a high-level explanation of how PCA works and how it can be used in the context of classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardization**: The first step in PCA is to standardize the data. This involves scaling the features so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is important because PCA is sensitive to the scale of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Covariance Matrix**: The next step is to compute the covariance matrix of the standardized data. The covariance matrix is a square matrix that shows the covariance between each pair of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: The covariance matrix is then decomposed into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvectors represent the directions of the new feature space, and the eigenvalues represent the magnitude of the variance in those directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sorting and Selecting Principal Components**: The eigenvectors are sorted in descending order of their corresponding eigenvalues. The top k eigenvectors are selected to form a new feature space, where k is the number of dimensions we want to reduce the data to.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Projection**: The original data is then projected onto the new feature space defined by the selected eigenvectors. This results in a lower-dimensional representation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Classification**: The reduced-dimensional data can then be used as input to a classification algorithm. The classification algorithm will learn to distinguish between the different classes based on the new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, PCA is a technique that can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data before applying a classification algorithm. It works by finding the directions of maximum variance in the data and projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional space defined by those directions. This can help to improve the performance of the classification algorithm by reducing the complexity of the data and removing noise."

    "\n",
    "**LDA** stands for **Linear Discriminant Analysis**. It’s a **supervised** method used for:\n",

    "- **Classification** (predicting which class a sample belongs to)\n",
    "- **Dimensionality reduction** (reducing the number of features while keeping class separation)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Goal of LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA tries to find a **line (or plane, or hyperplane)** that **best separates the classes** in your data.\n",

    "## 🧾 Step 4: Find the Best Direction\n",

    "J(w) = \\frac{w^T S_B w}{w^T S_W w}\n",

    "\n",
    "- It’s **supervised**, so it uses class labels to find the best separation.\n",

    "## 🚨 When LDA Fails\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the number of samples is **less than the number of features**, the **within-class covariance matrix becomes singular** (not invertible).\n",
