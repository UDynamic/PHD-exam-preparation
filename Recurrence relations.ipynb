    "Let’s break down the **difference between the sum of the number of nodes in a recurrence tree and the order (asymptotic time complexity)** in the context of analyzing recursive algorithms.\n",

    "### 🌲 1. **Recurrence Tree and Sum of Nodes**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **recurrence tree** is a visual tool used to **analyze the time complexity** of a recursive algorithm. Each node in the tree represents the cost of a subproblem at a certain level of recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Example: Recurrence $ T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n $\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s build the recurrence tree for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Level 0 (Root)**: $ n $ (cost of the original problem)\n",
    "- **Level 1**: Two subproblems each of size $ n/2 $, total cost = $ 2 \\times \\frac{n}{2} = n $\n",
    "- **Level 2**: Four subproblems each of size $ n/4 $, total cost = $ 4 \\times \\frac{n}{4} = n $\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- **Level $ \\log_2 n $**: $ 2^{\\log_2 n} = n $ subproblems each of size 1, total cost = $ n \\times 1 = n $\n",
    "\n",
    "So, **each level has a total cost of $ n $**, and there are $ \\log_2 n + 1 $ levels.\n",

    "### 📈 2. **Order of the Time Function (Asymptotic Complexity)**\n",

    "The **order of the time function** refers to the **asymptotic behavior** of the function $ T(n) $, usually expressed using **Big O**, **Omega**, or **Theta** notation.\n",

    "  - Each level has cost $ n $\n",

    "### 🧠 Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **sum of nodes** in the recurrence tree gives you the **exact cost** (up to a constant factor).\n",
