She broke up with me today. 
I teared my tears weeks ago in Shahreza. 

She wanted Marriage and Kids. 
I didn't. 

I feel like I Lost alot. 
I lost my bestfriend. 
The only one I trusted. 

So poetic to breakup on Valentine's day. 
just before the 2nd year anniversary.

## Getting over her
Don't worrie about it too much. 
You'll be fine. 
Just relax and give it time. 

Let it all out.
**But don't escalate the situation and your feelings.**
