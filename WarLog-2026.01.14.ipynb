    "### 🌟 What is a Markov Chain?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Markov chain** is a mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to another according to certain probabilistic rules. The key idea is the **Markov property**: the next state depends only on the current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is super useful in **machine learning** for modeling sequences like:\n",
    "- Speech recognition\n",
    "- Text generation\n",
    "- DNA sequences\n",
    "- Weather patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Equation 1: **Pₙ = P₀ × Tⁿ**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P₀** is the **initial probability vector** — it tells you the probability of being in each state at the beginning.\n",
    "- **T** is the **transition matrix** — it shows the probability of moving from one state to another.\n",
    "- **Tⁿ** means the transition matrix raised to the power of n — this gives you the probabilities after n steps.\n",
    "- **Pₙ** is the probability vector after n steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is like a time machine for your system. It shows how the probabilities of being in each state evolve over time.\n",

    "### 🧮 Equation 2: **P × T = P**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **Steady State Equation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P** is the **steady-state probability vector**.\n",
    "- **T** is the transition matrix.\n",
    "- The equation says: if you multiply the steady-state vector **P** by the transition matrix **T**, you get the same vector **P** back.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the system has reached a **steady state** — the probabilities no longer change with time. It's like the system has \"settled down\" and is in balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Why is this important in Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **pattern recognition** and **machine learning**, Markov chains are used to model sequences and predict future states based on the current one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**, we use these concepts to model sequences like speech, DNA, or text.\n",
    "- The **steady state** helps us understand the long-term behavior of a system.\n",
    "- In **reinforcement learning**, steady states can help us find optimal policies.\n",
    "- In **clustering** and **topic modeling**, steady states can reveal the most likely groupings or topics.\n",

It represents the long-term behavior of the system and is found by solving the system of linear equations derived from the transition matrix. For example, in a 2-state weather model with transition matrix $ T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.8 & 0.2 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.7 \\end{bmatrix} $, the steady-state distribution is $ \\pi = [0.6, 0.4] $, meaning the system will be Sunny 60% of the time and Rainy 40% in the long run.
