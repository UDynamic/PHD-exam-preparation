    "\n",
    "When you're working with **Markov chains**, one of the interesting questions you can ask is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **\"What is the expected number of times the process will stay in a particular state before leaving it?\"**\n",

    "This is especially useful when you're analyzing **stationary behavior**, **absorbing states**, or **long-term probabilities**.\n",

    "Let’s say you have a **transition matrix** $ T $ of size $ 3 \\times 3 $, and you're interested in the **expected number of times the process stays in state 1 (S₁)** before moving to another state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the **expected number of times the process stays in a state** is related to the **self-transition probability** of that state.\n",

    "0.2 & 0.5 & 0.3 \\\\\n",
    "0.4 & 0.1 & 0.5 \\\\\n",
