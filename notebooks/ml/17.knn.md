definition and distinction of different groups of classification methods including parametric vs none parametric and discreminative vs generative and Estimator's and calculators; including but not only these concepts:

1. regressions (linear and logistic) are parametric.
2. parametrics need training data for learning parameters to decide for the new data
3. none parametrics the training is not necessary and the training data is directly used.(almost all the work is done in test time)
4. K-NN is none parametric.
5. both supervised and unsupervised has parametric and none parametric methods
6. if the distribution is known but parameters are unknown we use MLE or MAP
7. Bayes classifier will give the optimal classification (p(\\theta) and p(x|\theta)
8. none parametrics are memory based or instance based
9.
