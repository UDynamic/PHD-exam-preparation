    "When someone says **\"solve for the recursive relation of T(n)\"**, they are asking you to **find a closed-form expression** for the recurrence relation or to **analyze its time complexity** in terms of **asymptotic notation** like **Big O**, **Omega**, or **Theta (Θ)**.\n",

    "### 🔹 What is a recurrence relation?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **recurrence relation** is a way of defining a function in terms of itself. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(n) = 2T\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) + n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the time to solve a problem of size $ n $ is equal to twice the time to solve a problem of size $ \\frac{n}{2} $, plus $ n $ for the extra work.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What does it mean to \"solve\" it?\n",
    "\n",
    "To **solve** a recurrence relation means to **find a closed-form expression** for $ T(n) $, or to **determine its asymptotic behavior** (i.e., how it grows as $ n $ becomes large).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, solving the recurrence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(n) = 2T\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) + n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "might give you:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(n) = \\Theta(n \\log n)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the time complexity grows **proportionally to $ n \\log n $** as $ n $ increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What is **order** or **Theta (Θ)**?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Big O (O)**: Describes the **upper bound** of the time complexity.\n",
    "- **Omega (Ω)**: Describes the **lower bound**.\n",
    "- **Theta (Θ)**: Describes the **tight bound**, meaning the function grows **at the same rate** as the given expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you're asked to **\"solve for the recursive relation and represent the order or theta\"**, you're being asked to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyze the recurrence.\n",
    "2. Find a **closed-form expression** or **asymptotic bound**.\n",
    "3. Express the result using **Big O**, **Omega**, or **Theta** notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you have the recurrence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(n) = T(n-1) + 1, \\quad T(1) = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can solve it step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(n) = T(n-1) + 1 = T(n-2) + 2 = \\dots = T(1) + (n-1) = 1 + (n-1) = n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(n) = n \\Rightarrow T(n) = \\Theta(n)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "### Summary\n",
