I want you to use the expected text format of the Anki export to turn the content flashcards input below to a proper text code block ready to get imported to AnkiDroid.

Important operations:

* drop the flashcard titles and only use the input flashcard's front and back to fill in the expected text format. so the format would be :
  {first column: guid,
  second: card type: always basic,
  third: deck name,
  4th: Front,
  5th: back}
* count the input data markdwon total flashcards and declare test result of total input and output flashcards.
* make sure any "`$$`" or "`$$$$`""  math expression in markdown input is turned into latex format \( \)
* new deck's name to fill in all the flashcards in the expected output:

call the deck: {####### to be filled #######}

the content of flashcards for this particular subject in markdown:
